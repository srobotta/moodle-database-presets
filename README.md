Presets for the Moodle database activity

## Overview

With the Moodle database activity many cool things can be created. In this repo I share some of my presets.
Inside the subdirectories the template files of the preset are included. Other files that are in the subdirectory
may contain additional data (images, metadata) so that the database activity works in the expected way.

## Content

Inside each subdirectory is an additional README.md that explains the specific preset.

### [Map with OSM and SVG](map-osm-and-svg/README.md)

## Installation

Any of these examples can be installed in your Moodle installation in the
following way:
1. In your course, create a new database activity. Give it a name and click on "Save and display".
2. In the next screen click the button "Import a preset", select the zip file for upload and click "Import preset and apply".
3. When the import was successful you should see a list of the field defintions.
To check the templates navigate in the tab to the template section and check them.

Before you see anything, start creating a few entries or import a sample dataset when provided.

Detailed instructions how templates should be applied to fit your needs are described
at each readme file inside the subdirectory of the preset.
