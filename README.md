Presets for the Moodle database activity

## Overview

With the Moodle database activity many cool things can be created. In this repo I share some of my presets.
Inside the sub directories the template files of the preset are included. Other files that are in the subdirectory
may contain additional data (images, meta data) so that the database activity works in the expected way.

## Content

Inside each subdirectory is an additional README.md that explains the specific preset.
