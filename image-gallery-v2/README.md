## Image gallery v2

Moodle itself contains a preset for an image gallery. At least in the boost
theme the layout didn't convince me that much. Therefore, I improved it a little.
In my opinion the list view has a more modern look with the responsive tiles.
Furthermore, there are no other customizations done.

<div style="margin: 0 25%">
